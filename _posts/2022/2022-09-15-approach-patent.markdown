Thomas Gumbricht has invented a novel approach for determining the abundance (concentration, density) of any target substance in a matrix of background material using spectral data: _A method and software product for providing a geometric abundance index of a target feature for spectral data_. The invented method is
owned by xSpecte AB, and we have applied for both a Swedish (Patent och registreringsverket, PRV) and International (Patent Cooperation Treaty, PCT). The PCT application (No: WO2022/159025) was [published online](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=SE372948068&_fid=WO2022159025) 2022-07-26.

The patent pending method uses a geometric transformation for interpreting spectral data. The method has several advantages compared to traditional spectral interpretation methods. The most important are the transparency in model formulation that allows expert in the target substance or its related field (i.e. soil properties and agriculture) to both understand and then calibrate the translation from spectra to soil properties. The method can further handle non-linear reflectance problems, adjust for errors and estimate abundance from fewer bands compared to traditional linear spectral mixing models.
