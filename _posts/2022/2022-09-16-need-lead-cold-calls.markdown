The European Commission summarises its mission for soil over the next decade as follows:  

"There is no life without soils. If soils are healthy and sustainably managed, they provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience [...]. We take these services for granted, but in fact soils are a scarce, non-renewable and threatened resource, all over Europe and globally. 60-70% of EU soils are unhealthy, mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The mission intends to support Europeâ€™s path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition in urban and rural areas."
