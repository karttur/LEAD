#### Introduction

[Agrocares](https://www.agrocares.com) is a Dutch company specialising in on-site soil, crop and pest monitoring. They offer three different [products](https://www.agrocares.com/products/):

- [lab-in-the-box for wet chemistry analysis](https://www.agrocares.com/products/lab-in-the-box/),
- [NIR scanner for soil and plant monitoring](https://www.agrocares.com/products/scanner/), and
- [scoutbox for insect pests](https://www.agrocares.com/products/scoutbox/)


#### NIR Scanner

Agrocares [NIR scanner](https://www.agrocares.com/products/scanner/) covers the spectral range 1300-2550nm using a Micro-electromechanical system (MEMS). The scanner also includes an alternate 1 kHz bi-polar measurement sensor.

Spectral reference data for determining the nutrient content of soils and feedstuffs include AgroCares own soil database and Trouw Nutrition's nutritional database.

The Scanner works with different apps for different purposes. Depending on the app you use, you can test the nutrients in a soil or a feed sample in real time. The apps are available on the Google Play Store and require Android version 5.0 or higher.

The spectrometer is probably a Fourier Transformed Infra-Red (FTIR) spectrometer with a Michelson moveable mirror, for example from [Ocean Insight](https://www.oceaninsight.com/products/spectrometers/near-infrared/), and reported in [Spectroscopy Europe](https://www.spectroscopyeurope.com/product/compact-mems-ft-nir-spectrometer). Ocean Insight also have a range of other [NIR spectroemters](https://www.oceaninsight.com/products/spectrometers/near-infrared/)

Can the light also be from ocean insight? https://www.oceaninsight.com/products/light-sources/light-source-bulbs/hl-2000-b-ll/?qty=1
But they only seem to have either 12 or 24 V, not 5 V.

[International light](https://www.intl-lighttech.com) provide light bulbs, they were recently bought up by Ocean Insight; [Tungsten Halogen & Gas Filled Lamps](https://www.intl-lighttech.com/applications/tungsten-halogen-gas-filled-lamps).

[Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com) has a 3.5 V, max 2A Tungsten broadband emitter |HEP3965](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=8554) that cost 1431 SEK and a Mounting adapter that cost 292 SEK. That is not too bad considering other alternatives. But the Agrocares [NIR scanner](https://www.agrocares.com/products/scanner/) has 8 Tungsten-halogen lamps so that must be some other brand. Need to find out which.
