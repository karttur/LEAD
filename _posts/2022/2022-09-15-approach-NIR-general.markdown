### NIR diffuse reflectance

NIR is today's leading analysis method for rapid quality analysis of e.g. grain and roughage and is also used to some extent for laboratory soil analyzes. With NIR spectroscopy it is possible to easily and quickly make both qualitative and quantitative measurements. The need for sample preparation is small and the measurement itself takes a few seconds. NIR stands for Near Infrared Reflectance and includes radiation within the wavelengths ~700 and ~2500 nm. This radiation has a fairly low energy content, which means that no protective equipment or dilution is needed. Another advantage of NIR is that the sample is not affected by the measurement and can thus be saved for more measurements.
The spectrum a NIR measurement generates is due to different molecules being able to absorb energy (wavelengths) that create intermolecular oscillations. Which wavelengths are absorbed depends on the kinds of molecules and bonds there are in a sample. Because the light is scattered when it is reflected and everything that is not absorbed thus does not reach the measuring probe (diffuse reflectance), it is not clear that the absorbance, i.e. the inverted reflectance, is directly proportional to a concentration. The absorption peaks therefore become unclear and overlapping and it is not possible to read a concentration directly from an absorption spectrum. For each new region, a number of calibration samples must therefore be analyzed with a reference method. Calibration thus becomes the most important step in NIR analysis. The number of samples needed depends on what is being analyzed and the variation in the data material. Through statistical calculations, analytical values ​​are correlated with the reflectance spectrum (if there is a relationship) and a model for predicting unknown samples can be created.
