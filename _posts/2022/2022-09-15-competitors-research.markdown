The research projects listed here are not exhaustive. The projects are not aiming at commercial products or services and are thus not direct competitors. The results from the research projects can potentially benefit both xSpectre as well as other commercial actors developing in-situ soil spectrometry.

#### Probe Field

[Probe field](https://ejpsoil.eu/soil-research/probefield) is a research project and part of the European Joint Programme (EJP) Soil. Probe Field aims at developing a novel protocol for robust in-situ monitoring of carbon stocks and soil fertility based on Visible (VIS) to Near Infra Red (NIR) in-situ spectroscopy combined with remote sensors and existing soil spectral libraries.

#### Steropes

[Steropes](https://ejpsoil.eu/soil-research/steropes) is also part of EJP Soil and aims at overcoming the limitations of static soil maps by putting the use of satellite time series forward, test their potential to predict cropland soil organic carbon content over various pedoclimatic conditions and cropping systems across Europe.
