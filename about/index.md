### xSpectre AB

xSpectre AB was founded in 2020 by Thomas Gumbricht and Hans Jacobson. The company was created to explore ideas around spectral sensing (measuring and interpreting how light interacts with different materials) recognizing the very fast development in miniaturized spectral sensors. We got VINNOVA startup funding in 2021 and developed and tested our first functional prototype consisting of three parts: 1) a handheld spectrometer, 2) a cross-platform app that is used for operating the spectrometer and also used for communication with 3) the online database and server solutions for interpreting spectral signals. The latter include a patent-pending mathematical-geometric spectral modeling environment used both for formulating the translation from spectral signal to sample content and for visualizing the sample content. In 2022 we got a small fund from Agtech2030 for further technical developments.

### intial focus: Agtech

Our initial target market is spectral sensing for monitoring and managing agricultural soils, or soil spectroscopy. Soil spectral analysis is today increasingly replacing traditional laboratory chemical analysis. A field spectral sensor has many advantages compared to traditional methods; it is cheaper (marginal costs for additional samples are negligible), it is fast (immediate results if there is network coverage) and it is always available. A new era in agricultural technology (agtech) including precision farming using soil and crop information and regenerative farming aiming at turning agricultural soils from sources to sinks of greenhouse gases demands cheap, fast and real time information.

### Business opportunities

In 2022 we have participated in Link√∂ping University Entrepreneurship and Development (LEAD) business development program and have come to understand that we need better entrepreneurial skills in the company to succeed. We also realized that there is a large demand for our solution and that a stable and easy-to-use version of the spectrometer could lead to both Business-to-Business as well as Business-to-Consumer opportunities for soil spectral sensing.

### Team

The team consists of Thomas Gumbricht and Hans Jacobson.

{: .pull-right}
Thomas is a PhD researcher from KTH who has worked for 25 years all over the world (based in Africa and Asia for 15 years) with mapping of soil, water and vegetation from spectral data collected both in laboratories and from satellite. He has developed the geometric-mathematical method for interpreting spectral data into soil properties and also created the handheld spectrometer.
